But if this will help with your investigation, then I'll tell you all I know. Alongside my husband, I greeted you when you arrived, [Detective]. Then I went upstairs to read in the [Master Bedroom]. I read until around 9:00 PM, then I went to bed. I didn't wake up until I heard [Ella] screaming this morning. I'm afraid I don't know anything else.";
        String edwardAlibi = "Sure, [Detective]. I'll tell you what I can. As you know, my father summoned me and [Edric] to the [Library] around 8:00 PM last night. We talked for a while about Father's mining business. Then [Edric] went to bed around 9:00, and you, Father, and I moved into the [Study]. We talked about how you got to know Father when you investigated disruptions to mining operations in Eboracum. Then you went to bed around 10:00. Father and I went over estate affairs for another hour and half. [Thomas] came in around 11:00 to check on us, and everything seemed completely normal. When I went to bed around 11:30, I left my father still going over the estate's taxes. Please, find out what happened to my father.";

I did wake up at some time during the night, I think around 2:00 AM. I went downstairs to get some water from the [Kitchen], since I didn't want to wake anyone up at that hour just for water. When I was in the [Foyer] I could see light coming from the [Study], so I assumed my father was still working and went back to bed. Do you think he was already dead then? What if I could have helped him? Oh please, [Detective], you have to find out what happened!";

Orâ€¦ wait a second. I did wake up at one point during the night. I'm usually a pretty light sleeper, so something must have woken me up, but I didn't hear or see anything once I was awake. I'm not sure when exactly it was, but I heard the clock in the [Foyer] strike 4:00 AM while I was trying to fall back asleep. I'm praying you sort this out soon, [Detective]. ";

I first locked all the doors to the manor around 10:30 PM. Then I made a sweep of the first floor just to check that everything was tidied up. I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. The last stop of my sweep was the [Study]. When I got there, the [Count] and [Lord Edward] were still going over papers. I made sure they didn't need anything, then I put my keys in the [Office] and went to bed. I got up at 5:00 AM along with [Ella] and [Maria]. I then picked up my keys from the [Office] where I left them and unlocked all the doors to the manor. Then I went back to the [Office] to review tasks for today. I didn't know what had happened until one of the servants came in to inform me of your investigation. I hope my information helps.";

I helped the [Countess] change into her nightgown and get settled in the [Master Bedroom] around 8:30 PM last night. Then I went to get [Lady Edith] ready for bed around 9:00 PM. I passed [Lord Edric] in the [Upstairs Hallway] as I was leaving [Edith's Bedroom]. [Lord Edric] looked like he was also going to bed. After that, I went downstairs to the [Kitchen] to go over the day's work and talk with [Maria] while she cleaned up and prepared for breakfast today. [Thomas] dropped by around 11:00 PM to tell us he was going to bed. [Maria] and I talked for a while longer, then both went to bed shortly after the clock struck midnight. I didn't get up until 5:00 AM, which is when I usually get up. I first woke all the other servants, and all of us ate breakfast in the [Kitchen]. I finished earlier than most of the others and went to do a sweep of the downstairs to see what work needed to be done. That's when I entered the [Study] and found the [Count]. I'm afraid I can't remember anything more.";

I spend most of my time in the [Kitchen], so I don't interact much with the rest of the household, especially not the [Count]. I was in the [Kitchen] all of last night, and [Ella] joined me for a while. We both went to bed around midnight. When I got up in the morning, I went straight to the [Kitchen], and I haven't left it since. I only know what's going on because one of the other servants told me. The only unusual thing that happened to me in the past day was that I had to cook more food because of your unexpected visit. Good luck with the case, [Detective], but I can't help you.";

I went to my cabin on the estate grounds around 10:00 PM, and I was there all night. I couldn't have gotten back in the manor if I tried -- [Thomas] locks the doors at night, you can ask him. Although, now that I think about it, when I got up and did my morning sweep of the grounds around 4:00 AM, I thought I saw someone in a long coat moving in the [Upstairs Hallway]. It was still dark outside so I couldn't see well, but I could've sworn there was someone there. I hope that helps.";
